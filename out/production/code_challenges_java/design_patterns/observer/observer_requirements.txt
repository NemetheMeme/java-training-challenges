Imagine the following scenario: "a teacher in front of a class full of students". When the
teacher teaches, the students receive the info that the teacher is sharing with them.

The teacher is "observed" subject and students "observe" the teacher.

Given the interfaces below, implement Student class and Teacher class so that the following
main method will print the expected message.

public interface ObservedSubject{
    void register(Observer obj);
    void unregister(Observer obj);
    void notifyObservers(String message);
}
public interface Observer{
    void update(String message);
}
