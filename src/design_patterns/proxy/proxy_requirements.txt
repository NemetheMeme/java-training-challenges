Given the following scenario: "A student want to rent an apartment from a real estate agent",
make use of the proxy design pattern and implement this scenario in an OO way.

The real estate agent had some issues in the past with student that have their names starting
with the letter "P" and now they refuse to rent apartment to anybody who's name starts with
the letter "P".

Implement a class Apartment
    location: String
    monthlyRentCost: int
 and a class Student
    name: String
    money: int

The RealEstateAgentProxy has 2 methods:
    void represent(Apartment apartment);
    Apartment rent(Student student, Apartment apartmentToBeRented);
